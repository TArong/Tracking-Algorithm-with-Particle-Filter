# Tracking-Algorithm-with-Particle-Filter

The Postsegmentation2 / Segmentation_Without_Dominant are the segmentation algorithm I used in my algorithm, but they were not what I designed.

The video object tracking algorithm I proposed is SISP.  It contains Particle Filter, Diffusion Distance, Segmentation.  The main function locates at CnvntnlPFTrial.cpp.

I also designed a hardware platform for Computer Vision Algorithms in the RTL folder.

Everything about the algorithm and the hardware platform can be found in my thesis.
